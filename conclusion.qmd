# Conclusion

By bringing together multiple FEC datasets and pairing them with visual analytics, we uncover how much money candidates receive, where it comes from, how efficiently they spend it, and how committees, PACs, and donor networks shape the modern election ecosystem.

A clear trend emerges early: 2020 was a far larger fundraising year than 2024. The Democratic primary in 2020 featured a large, competitive field—Biden, Sanders, Bloomberg, Warren, Buttigieg, Klobuchar, and others—driving massive national fundraising activity. By contrast, 2024 had a much smaller, more consolidated field; after President Biden withdrew and endorsed Vice President Harris, Democratic fundraising funneled into a single candidate. Meanwhile, Trump’s 2024 fundraising appeared fragmented at first because his money did not flow through a single candidate committee. Only after merging multiple FEC files—candidate receipts, committee activity, transfers, and PAC data—did his full fundraising footprint become visible. Once reconstructed, Trump emerged as one of the top fundraisers in both cycles.

The sources of money reveal distinct financial identities for different candidates. In 2020, Bloomberg and Steyer funded themselves almost entirely. Sanders and Warren depended heavily on small individual donors, while Biden drew a balanced mix of grassroots donations, PAC/party transfers, and high-dollar contributions. In 2024, Harris relied on major party transfers after Biden’s withdrawal, while Trump drew from a blended pipeline of small donors, PACs, and joint fundraising committees (JFCs) such as Save America PAC, MAGA Inc., and WinRed. Candidates like Ramaswamy in 2024 were self-funded, while Kennedy showed a mix of individual contributions and unconventional “other receipts.” PCA and composition charts reinforce these distinctions, revealing natural clusters: self-funders, grassroots-funded candidates, party-backed nominees, and committee-network candidates.

Fundraising inequality is one of the strongest patterns we observe. In both years, the Pareto chart shows that the top 5% of candidates capture 90–95% of all money raised, leaving the remaining candidates to split only a small fraction. This dramatic imbalance explains much of the campaign landscape: only a few candidates have the resources to run national operations, advertise meaningfully, and remain competitive.

On the spending side, 2020 saw enormous campaign outlays from Bloomberg, Biden, and Trump, while in 2024 the biggest spenders were Harris and Trump. The burn-rate analysis—comparing money raised versus money spent—illustrates how aggressively different campaigns operate. Candidates on the dashed line spend nearly all the money they raise; those above it spend more than they bring in, often by taking out loans; and those below it build financial reserves. Bloomberg and Biden in 2020 burned through almost all their funds, while Harris’s 2024 campaign operated with a similarly high burn rate. Trump, after accounting for all linked committees, appeared more measured relative to receipts than raw candidate-committee data first suggested.

The cash-on-hand ridge plots highlight how much money campaigns keep in reserve after expenses. A log scale is essential here because candidates vary from having almost nothing left to retaining millions. Democrats and Republicans show different spreads in different cycles: sometimes the Republican field contains more outliers; sometimes Democrats exhibit tighter clustering. But across both years, most minor candidates end their campaigns with very little liquidity, while only major contenders hold meaningful cash.

The political landscape is influenced not only by campaigns themselves but also by independent expenditure groups. In 2020, large sums came from committees such as America First Action, Preserve America PAC, and Priorities USA. In 2024, new players like FF PAC and Food & Water Action emerged. These groups spend millions either supporting their preferred candidate or opposing their rivals, making them a powerful force parallel to official campaigns.

Finally, the alluvial and Sankey flow diagrams tie everything together by showing how money actually moves through the campaign finance ecosystem. In 2020, the flows are relatively straightforward: small and large donors → ActBlue or WinRed → joint fundraising committees → final campaign accounts → operating expenses. By 2024, however, the Republican financing system becomes far more fragmented. Democrats remain streamlined through ActBlue, but Trump’s fundraising network expands into multiple connected entities: joint fundraising committees (Trump Save America JFC), leadership PACs (Save America PAC), super PACs (MAGA Inc.), and WinRed. This multi-layered design provides strategic advantages—allowing large donations to be split across committees, enabling PACs to cover expenses campaigns cannot, giving Trump more independence from the RNC, and maximizing small-donor conversion online.

Taken together, these findings reveal a transformed campaign finance landscape. Fundraising is highly unequal, dominated by a few well-resourced candidates. Candidates rely on distinct financial models—self-funding, grassroots donors, party machinery, or complex committee networks. Modern campaigns depend heavily on digital fundraising platforms, PACs, JFCs, and outside groups, which collectively shape the flow of money. And the shift from 2020 to 2024 illustrates how campaign finance has evolved from traditional candidate committees into sophisticated, engineered ecosystems of interconnected fundraising channels.

In summary, the story across every graph is the same: presidential campaigns are no longer just about candidate fundraising—they are about managing an entire financial ecosystem, where money moves through networks of donors, platforms, committees, and PACs before ultimately influencing who leads the country.
