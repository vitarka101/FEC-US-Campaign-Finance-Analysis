By bringing together multiple FEC datasets and visual analyses, we reveal how dramatically the campaign finance landscape has shifted from 2020 to 2024. The 2020 cycle was defined by a huge, competitive Democratic field that drove record fundraising—self-funders like Bloomberg, grassroots-powered candidates like Sanders and Warren, and Biden’s mixed donor base all created a broad, high-volume money environment. In 2024, the field was far smaller. Democratic fundraising quickly consolidated behind Harris after Biden’s withdrawal, while Trump’s financial picture only became clear once we combined his candidate filings with PACs, JFCs, and committee transfers. What first looked fragmented turned into one of the strongest fundraising networks of the cycle.

Across both years, a striking pattern repeats: a tiny group of candidates captures nearly all the money. The top few contenders raise and spend at national scale, while most others operate with minimal resources. Burn-rate, cash-on-hand, and spending analyses show how differently campaigns use their funds—some burning through everything to stay competitive, others building reserves, and outside groups like super PACs increasingly acting as parallel financial engines.

Ultimately, the data reveals that modern presidential campaigns are no longer just about raising money they are about navigating and managing an entire financial ecosystem. Donations move through platforms, PACs, joint committees, and party networks before reaching campaigns, making fundraising both more unequal and more strategically engineered than ever before.
