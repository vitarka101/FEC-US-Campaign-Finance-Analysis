    "text": "Money has a big impact on American elections. It affects which candidates get attention, how they share their message, and which voices are heard by voters. But for most people, it is hard to see where all that money comes from and how it is used. We chose this topic because we want to understand how campaign money moves during presidential elections. We are interested in finding out who raises the most money, how campaigns spend it, and how this has changed over the years. Some questions we want to look at are:\n\nWhich candidates and parties raise the most money, and from what sources?\nHow do different campaigns spend their funds?\nHas independent spending grown in influence?\nWhat kinds of committees and donors contribute the most?\nAre there any clear financial patterns that seem to separate winning campaigns from others?\n\nBy using and visualizing data from the Federal Election Commission (FEC), we hope to find clear trends that show how money shapes elections in the United States today.\nFederal campaign finance data is vast, detailed, and often overwhelming, but it offers one of the clearest windows into how political power is built in the United States. Every federal candidate and political committee is legally required to disclose where their money comes from and how it is spent, and the Federal Election Commission (FEC) compiles these reports into a public database that spans decades of elections. This dataset includes information on presidential, Senate, and House campaigns, independent expenditure groups, political action committees (PACs), party committees, and more.\nAlthough the FEC provides millions of records, our project focuses exclusively on the presidential election cycle, where financial activity is typically the largest and most influential. Presidential campaigns raise far more money than congressional campaigns, attract more independent spending, and involve extensive networks of committees, donors, and outside groups. This makes the dataset ideal for exploring patterns in political fundraising at a national scale.\nTo build our analysis, we rely on official, publicly accessible FEC data obtained through the FEC Open Data API. This API provides structured access to many components of the campaign finance system, such as:\n\nCandidate-level summaries, including total receipts, disbursements, cash on hand, loans, and debts\nCommittee-level activity, showing how affiliated committees raise and spend money\nItemized contributions, detailing individual donors, PAC contributions, and transfers\nIndependent expenditures, which capture spending by outside groups attempting to influence an election\n\nThese sources allow us to reconstruct a full financial picture of each presidential campaign, tracking how money enters, circulates, and is deployed throughout an election cycle.\nA central part of our project is a comparative analysis of two recent presidential elections: 2020 and 2024. These two cycles offer a natural contrast—not only in political outcome, but also in financial structure. Democrats won the presidency in 2020, while Republicans prevailed in 2024. By comparing how much money each side raised, how they spent it, and how independent groups participated, we can evaluate whether financial patterns shifted alongside electoral results.\nFor instance, one might ask whether the winning party in each cycle benefited from stronger grassroots fundraising, larger PAC contributions, more aggressive spending, or greater support from outside groups. Alternatively, the strength of independent expenditures may reveal how much influence super PACs and other organizations exerted relative to the campaigns themselves.\nBy narrowing our scope to these two election years and applying exploratory data analysis techniques, we aim to uncover meaningful trends in how campaign financing evolves—and how those changes may relate to shifts in political power. Ultimately, this project uses data from the FEC not only to visualize financial flows, but also to better understand how money functions as a strategic resource in modern presidential elections.",

Fundraising in 2020 was significantly higher, with candidates collectively bringing in over $8.5 billion, compared to roughly $6.8 billion in 2024.This was primarily because the 2020 race was a much more expensive and competitive cycle, driven by a large field of high-profile candidates, including Joe Biden, Donald Trump, Michael Bloomberg, and Bernie Sanders, who attracted substantial donor attention. In contrast, 2024 saw a dip in total fundraising, likely because the field was smaller, less fragmented, and had fewer candidates running large, nationally funded campaigns.\nThe horizontal bar chart shows the below information: - In 2020, we can see that Bloomberg was the highest fundraiser followed by Biden.",

We found that Trump raised the majority of his 2024 funds through joint fundraising committees and PACs, rather than through a single candidate committee. As a result, his financial activity did not appear in the standard candidate receipts file and required additional data integration.\nTo address this gap and ensure that all major candidates were represented in our analysis, we merged information from multiple FEC data sources, including candidate filings, committee filings, individual contributions, receipts, and disbursements. This process allowed us to construct a unified dataset that accurately reflects the financial activity of key presidential contenders across both election cycles.\nThe resulting combined Excel will serve as the foundation for all subsequent analysis and visualizations in this project, ensuring completeness and consistency in our comparisons.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(readxl)\nlibrary(dplyr)\nlibrary(tidyr)\nlibrary(stringr)\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(forcats)\n\n#-----------------------------\n# 1.

The distribution is wide, showing a large number of candidates competing and raising serious money. In 2024, the number of Democratic candidates raising large amounts shrinks noticeably—only a few candidates raised major funds, reflecting a much smaller field after Biden’s withdrawal and consolidation behind Kamala Harris.\nRepublicans: Republican fundraising is more spread out across different levels for both years. In 2020, there were fewer Republican candidates compared to Democrats, but those who did run raised money across a broad range. In 2024, the pattern is similar, with several mid-level fundraisers but fewer extremely high-fundraising campaigns. This reflects the fact that Donald Trump’s fundraising largely passed through committees, not directly through a candidate committee, so his amounts don’t appear in this specific view.\nOthers / Independents: Both years show a very large number of minor candidates raising very small amounts—typically in the tens of thousands or low hundreds of thousands. A few outliers raised more, but this group is overwhelmingly made up of low-fundraising campaigns.\nOverall: Across both years and all parties, most candidates raise relatively small amounts, while only a handful raise extremely large sums. The 2020 cycle shows a larger, more competitive, and more expensive Democratic field, while 2024 shows fewer high-fundraising candidates overall. The log-scale helps show these differences despite huge variations in fundraising levels.",

The curve rises very sharply at the beginning, which means that only a tiny fraction of candidates are responsible for bringing in most of the money. In both years, roughly the top 5% of candidates account for almost 90–95% of all campaign receipts.\nAfter that small group, the curve flattens out, showing that the remaining candidates raise very little in comparison. This confirms a strong Pareto pattern: a small group of major contenders—such as Biden, Trump, Bloomberg, Harris, and others—dominate the fundraising landscape, while most candidates operate with minimal financial support.",

Starting around 2012, PACs begin raising way more money than everyone else, and their totals keep shooting up. The main reason is that Super PACs are allowed to raise unlimited money, so wealthy donors and big organizations can give as much as they want. Party Committees also grow steadily, especially during election years, but nowhere near the level of PACs. Candidates raise the least money overall and mostly see increases only when their election campaigns are active. Overall, the chart shows how much U.S. elections now rely on outside fundraising groups rather than just the candidates themselves.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(dplyr)\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(tidytext)\nlibrary(forcats)\n\n# 1.

Hovering over the dots displays the exact values of the funds raised. Initially, Trump was missing from the 2024 charts because his money flowed through multiple committees instead of a single candidate account. After we combined data from all the different FEC files—candidate receipts, committee filings, PAC data, and disbursement records—Trump’s total fundraising became visible. This combined dataset gives a more accurate picture of the major candidates, and we can now see Trump standing out prominently in both 2020 and 2024.\n\nHow do different campaigns spend their funds?\n\n\n\nCode\nparty_medians &lt;- candidates |&gt;\n  filter(\n    total_receipt &gt; 10000,\n    party_simple %in% c(\"Democrats\", \"Republicans\", \"Others\")\n  ) |&gt;\n  group_by(election_year, party_simple) |&gt;\n  summarise(med_receipt = median(total_receipt, na.rm = TRUE), .groups = \"drop\")\n\n# Merge medians back for plotting\ncandidates_sorted &lt;- candidates |&gt;\n  filter(\n    total_receipt &gt; 10000,\n    party_simple %in% c(\"Democrats\", \"Republicans\", \"Others\")\n  ) |&gt;\n  left_join(party_medians, by = c(\"election_year\", \"party_simple\")) |&gt;\n  mutate(\n    party_reordered = reorder_within(party_simple, med_receipt, election_year)\n  )\n\np3_box &lt;- candidates_sorted |&gt;\n  ggplot(aes(\n    x = total_receipt,\n    y = party_reordered,\n    fill = party_simple\n  )) +\n  \n  geom_boxplot(alpha = 0.75, outlier.alpha = 0.4, width = 0.6) +\n  \n  facet_wrap(~ election_year, ncol = 1, scales = \"free_y\") +\n  \n  scale_y_reordered() +   # &lt;--- THIS FIXES THE ORDERING PER FACET\n  \n  scale_x_log10(\n    breaks = c(1e3, 1e4, 1e5, 1e6, 1e7, 1e8, 1e9),\n    labels = c(\"$0.001M\",\"$0.01M\", \"$0.1M\", \"$1M\", \"$10M\", \"$100M\", \"$1,000M\"),\n    expand = expansion(mult = c(0.02, 0.05))\n  ) +\n  \n  scale_fill_manual(\n    values = c(\n    \"Democrats\"   = \"#1D4ED8\",\n    \"Republicans\" = \"#B91C1C\",\n    \"Others\"      = \"#95A3A6\"\n    )\n  ) +\n  \n  labs(\n    title = \"Distribution of Campaign Funds Raised by Party\",\n    subtitle = \"Parties sorted by median funds raised (log scale)\",\n    x = \"Funds Raised (In Millions)\",\n    y = \"Party\",\n    fill = \"Party\"\n  ) +\n  \n  theme_minimal(base_size = 14) +\n  theme(\n    axis.text.y = element_text(face = \"bold\", size = 12),\n    axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 0, size = 10),\n    strip.text = element_text(face = \"bold\", size = 14),\n    plot.title = element_text(face = \"bold\", size = 18),\n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size = 12, color = \"gray30\"),\n    axis.title.x = element_text(face = \"bold\", size = 12),\n    axis.title.y = element_text(face = \"bold\", size = 12),\n    legend.position = \"none\",\n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),\n    panel.grid.major.y = element_blank(),\n    plot.margin = margin(20, 20, 20, 20)\n  )\n\np3_box\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3.3.3 Observation:\nIn 2020, Democrats had the highest median and the widest IQR, meaning their candidates varied the most in money raised, with several very large outliers. Republicans were more consistent with a smaller spread, and “Others” raised the least with minimal variation. In 2024, Republicans show a wider IQR and more high-value outliers—largely due to major fundraisers—while Democrats have a narrower range than in 2020. “Others” remain lowest overall. In short, Democrats showed the biggest fundraising spread in 2020, while Republicans showed the widest spread in 2024.\n\n\nCode\n## sort graph, make better if possible -&gt; Ayush\n\nlibrary(dplyr)\nlibrary(tidyr)\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(forcats)\n\n# We will use the \"receipts_all\" object from before.\n# And the \"top10_receipts\" object we already created.\n\n#---------------------------------\n# 1.

In 2020, Bloomberg and Steyer relied mostly on self-funding, while Sanders, Warren, and Buttigieg raised mainly from individual donors. Biden had a balanced mix of individuals and party/PAC support. In 2024, Harris received large party and PAC transfers, Trump combined individual donations with PAC/committee funding, Kennedy mixed individuals with other receipts, and Ramaswamy relied heavily on self-funding. Overall, the chart highlights not just who raised the most money, but how they raised it—revealing the very different financial structures behind each campaign.\n\n\nCode\nread_pres_disbursements &lt;- function(path, year) {\n  \n  raw &lt;- suppressMessages(read_xlsx(path, col_names = FALSE))\n  \n  colnames(raw) &lt;- c(\n    \"group\",\n    \"candidate\",\n    \"operating_exp\",\n    \"transfers\",\n    \"fundraising_disb\",\n    \"legal_acct\",\n    \"loan_repayments\",\n    \"contrib_refunds\",\n    \"other_disb\",\n    \"total_disb\",\n    \"cash_on_hand\",\n    \"debts_owed_by\",\n    \"debts_owed_to\"\n  )\n  \n  cleaned &lt;- raw |&gt;\n    # Identify rows that are party headers (group not NA, candidate empty)\n    mutate(\n      party_header = if_else(!is.na(group) & is.na(candidate), group, NA_character_)\n    ) |&gt;\n    fill(party_header) |&gt;     # spread party downwards\n    \n    # Keep rows with real candidates\n    filter(!is.na(candidate)) |&gt;\n    filter(!str_detect(candidate, \"^Other .*candidates\")) |&gt;  # remove aggregates\n    \n    # Clean party label\n    mutate(\n      party = case_when(\n        str_detect(party_header, \"Republican\") ~ \"Republican\",\n        str_detect(party_header, \"Democrat\")   ~ \"Democrat\",\n        str_detect(party_header, \"Other\")      ~ \"Other\",\n        TRUE ~ \"Unknown\"\n      ),\n      year = year\n    ) |&gt;\n    \n    # Convert money columns\n    mutate(\n      across(operating_exp:debts_owed_to,\n             ~ suppressWarnings(as.numeric(str_replace_all(.x, \"[$,]\", \"\"))))\n    ) |&gt;\n  \n    filter(if_any(operating_exp:debts_owed_to, ~ !is.na(.x)))\n  \n  cleaned\n}\n\ndisb_2020 &lt;- read_pres_disbursements(\"PresCand2_2020_disembursements.xlsx\", 2020)\ndisb_2024 &lt;- read_pres_disbursements(\"PresCand2_2024_disembursemnt.xlsx\", 2024)\n\ndisbursements_all &lt;- bind_rows(disb_2020, disb_2024)\n\n\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(dplyr)\nlibrary(forcats)\nlibrary(scales)\n\n\ntop_spenders &lt;- disbursements_all |&gt;\n  group_by(year) |&gt;\n  slice_max(total_disb, n = 10) |&gt;\n  ungroup() |&gt;\n  mutate(candidate = fct_reorder(candidate, total_disb))\n\n\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(dplyr)\nlibrary(forcats)\nlibrary(scales)\nlibrary(plotly)\n\ntop_spenders &lt;- disbursements_all |&gt;\n  group_by(year) |&gt;\n  slice_max(total_disb, n = 10) |&gt;\n  ungroup() |&gt;\n  mutate(\n    candidate_sorted = fct_reorder(candidate, total_disb),\n    # Create tooltip text\n    tooltip = paste0(\n      \"&lt;b&gt;\", candidate, \"&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;\",\n      \"Party: \", party, \"&lt;br&gt;\",\n      \"Total Spending: $\", round(total_disb / 1e6, 2), \"M&lt;br&gt;\",\n      \"Year: \", year\n    )\n  )\n\np1 &lt;- ggplot(top_spenders,\n             aes(x = total_disb / 1e6,\n                 y = candidate_sorted,\n                 color = party,\n                 text = tooltip)) +\n  geom_point(size = 1.8) +\n  facet_wrap(~ year, ncol = 2, scales = \"free_y\") +\n  scale_y_reordered() +\n  scale_color_manual(values = c(\n    \"Democrat\"   = \"#1D4ED8\",\n    \"Republican\" = \"#B91C1C\",\n    \"Other\"      = \"#95A3A6\"\n  )) +\n  scale_x_continuous(\n    labels = function(x) paste0(\"$\", x, \"M\")\n  ) +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Top 10 Presidential Campaigns by Total Spending\",\n    x = \"Total Disbursements (In Millions)\",\n    y = \"Candidate Name\",\n    color = \"Party\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal(base_size = 11) +\n  theme(\n    panel.spacing = unit(0.4, \"lines\"),\n    axis.text.y = element_text(size = 9),\n    axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1, vjust = 1),\n    strip.text = element_text(size = 12)\n  )\n\nggplotly(p1, tooltip = \"text\", height = 500)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3.3.5 Observation:\nThis chart shows which presidential campaigns spent the most money in 2020 and 2024.

The dashed line in the chart represents spending equal to fundraising. Candidates on the line spent almost exactly what they brought in, those above the line spent more than they raised (often by tapping loans or debt), and those below the line spent less than they raised.\nIn 2020, Bloomberg and Biden sit close to the line, meaning they burned through nearly all their funds, while Trump spent slightly less but still operated at a high burn rate. Most other candidates fall well below the line, showing more conservative spending. In 2024, Kamala Harris has one of the highest burn rates, nearly matching or exceeding what she raised, while Trump and much of the Republican field appear lower on the chart, spending more cautiously relative to their receipts. Overall, only a few major campaigns burn cash extremely quickly, while most operate far below their total fundraising.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(ggrepel)\n# --- Build the base ridge plot (your p2_ridge_year_based) ---\np2_ridge_year_based &lt;- candidates |&gt;\n  filter(total_receipt &gt; 100000) |&gt;                      # remove tiny campaigns\n  mutate(\n    cash_pct = cash_on_hand_cop / pmax(total_receipt, 1) * 100\n  ) |&gt;\n  filter(!is.na(cash_pct), cash_pct &gt; 0) |&gt;\n  filter(party_simple %in% c(\"Democrats\", \"Republicans\", \"Others\")) |&gt;\n  add_count(party_simple, election_year, name = \"group_n\") |&gt;\n  filter(group_n &gt;= 3) |&gt;\n  \n  ggplot(aes(\n    x = cash_pct,\n    y = factor(election_year),        # y-axis = election year\n    fill = party_simple,\n    color = party_simple\n  )) +\n  \n  geom_density_ridges(\n    alpha = 0.55,\n    scale = 1.4,\n    rel_min_height = 0.01,\n    size = 0.3\n  ) +\n  \n  scale_x_log10(labels = scales::percent_format(scale = 1)) +\n  \n  scale_fill_manual(\n    values = c(\n      \"Democrats\"   = \"#1D4ED8\",\n      \"Republicans\" = \"#B91C1C\",\n      \"Others\"      = \"#95A3A6\"\n    ),\n    name = \"Party\"\n  ) +\n  \n  scale_color_manual(\n    values = c(\n      \"Democrats\"   = \"#1D4ED8\",\n      \"Republicans\" = \"#B91C1C\",\n      \"Others\"      = \"#95A3A6\"\n    ),\n    name = \"Party\"\n  ) +\n  \n  labs(\n    title = \"Cash on Hand Distribution by Election Year\",\n    subtitle = \"Ridges show liquidity distribution for each party in each cycle\",\n    x = \"Cash on Hand (%)\",\n    y = \"Election Year\"\n  ) +\n  \n  theme_minimal(base_size = 14) +\n  theme(\n    legend.position = \"top\",\n    plot.title = element_text(face = \"bold\", size = 18)\n  )\n\n# --- Identify top candidates (top 10% by receipts per year) ---\ntop_candidates &lt;- candidates |&gt;\n  mutate(\n    cash_pct = cash_on_hand_cop / pmax(total_receipt, 1) * 100,\n    last_name = sub(\",.*\", \"\", cand_name)    # ← Extract last name before comma\n  ) |&gt;\n  filter(\n    total_receipt &gt; 100000,\n    party_simple %in% c(\"Democrats\", \"Republicans\", \"Others\"),\n    cash_pct &gt; 0\n  ) |&gt;\n  group_by(election_year) |&gt;\n  mutate(receipt_rank = percent_rank(total_receipt)) |&gt;\n  filter(receipt_rank &gt;= 0.90) |&gt;           # ← Top 10%\n  ungroup()\n\n# --- Ridge plot WITH points & last-name labels ---\np2_ridge_with_points &lt;- p2_ridge_year_based +\n  \n  geom_point(\n    data = top_candidates,\n    aes(\n      x = cash_pct,\n      y = factor(election_year),\n      color = party_simple\n    ),\n    size = 2.6,\n    alpha = 0.85\n  ) +\n  \n  geom_text_repel(\n    data = top_candidates,\n    aes(\n      x = cash_pct,\n      y = factor(election_year),\n      label = last_name,\n      color = party_simple\n    ),\n    size = 2.7,\n    nudge_y = 0.25,\n    max.overlaps = Inf,\n    box.padding = 0.25,\n    point.padding = 0.2,\n    segment.color = \"gray60\",\n    direction = \"y\"\n  )\n\np2_ridge_with_points\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3.4.2 Observation:\nCash on hand is basically leftover campaign money – how much cash a candidate still has in the bank after all their fundraising and spending. So this chart is showing, for each election year (2020 vs 2024) and each party, how that leftover cash is distributed across their candidates. The ridges are like smoothed histograms: tall, wide bumps mean “lots of candidates with around this level of cash on hand.”\nThe x-axis is on a log scale, which means each step is a big jump (0.01% → 0.1% → 1% → 10% etc.), not a small linear step. We use log scale because some campaigns keep tiny amounts of cash on hand while a few hold huge reserves; on a normal scale the small values would be squished and impossible to compare. Log scaling stretches out the low end so you can see both “lean” and “cash-rich” campaigns on the same plot.\nThe red ridges extend slightly to the left of the first tick mark (“0.00%”). That does not mean there are negative values. All cash on hand values are positive – we filtered out zeros. What you’re seeing is just the ridge curve tapering off into very small positive values that are below the first labeled tick on the log axis. Ridge plots always have these smooth tails; they’re showing the shape of the distribution, not individual negative money.\n\n\nCode\ntop_spenders &lt;- independent_exp |&gt;\n  filter(cand_name != \"Akhlaghy, Nader\") |&gt;      \n  group_by(spe_nam, election_year, support_oppose) |&gt;\n  summarise(\n    total_spent = sum(exp_amo, na.rm = TRUE),\n    n_expenditures = n(),\n    .groups = \"drop\"\n  ) |&gt;\n  group_by(election_year) |&gt;\n  slice_max(total_spent, n = 10) |&gt;\n  ungroup()\n\np5_spenders &lt;- top_spenders |&gt;\n  ggplot(aes(\n    x = reorder(spe_nam, total_spent),\n    y = total_spent,\n    fill = support_oppose\n  )) +\n  \n  geom_col(alpha = 0.85) +\n  facet_wrap(~ election_year, scales = \"free_y\", ncol = 1) +\n  \n  scale_y_continuous(labels = dollar_format(scale = 1e-6, suffix = \"M\")) +\n  \n  scale_fill_manual(\n    values = c(\n      \"Support\" = \"#2ECC71\",   # green\n      \"Oppose\"  = \"#E67E22\"    # orange\n    )\n  ) +\n  \n  coord_flip() +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Top 10 Independent Spenders by Year\",\n    subtitle = \"Organizations spending the most to \\ninfluence presidential campaigns\",\n    x = \"Committee Name\",\n    y = \"Total Spent\",\n    fill = \"Stance\"\n  ) +\n  \n  theme_minimal(base_size = 13) +\n  theme(\n    axis.text.y = element_text(size = 9, face = \"bold\"),\n    strip.text = element_text(size = 14, face = \"bold\"),\n    plot.title = element_text(face = \"bold\", size = 18)\n  )\n\np5_spenders\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3.4.3 Observation:\nThis chart shows which independent committees spent the most money trying to influence presidential elections in 2020 and 2024, and whether that money was used to support or oppose specific candidates. Independent spending isn’t tied to a single campaign—these committees can support any candidate or oppose any candidate, regardless of party.\nIn 2020, a few committees spent extremely large amounts, with Spirit of Reforming America dominating overall support spending. Other groups like America First Action and Preserve America PAC focused heavily on opposition spending. By 2024, the pattern continues but with new major players, such as Food & Water Action and FF PAC, showing strong support activity. At the same time, several committees spent substantial amounts opposing candidates, reflecting how competitive and aggressive modern campaign environments have become.\nOverall, the chart highlights not just how much money flows into elections, but how independent groups strategically use funds—either boosting favored candidates or targeting opponents across both cycles.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(networkD3)\n\n########## 2020 ##########\n\nnodes20 &lt;- data.frame(name = c(\n  \"Small Donors\",          # 0\n  \"Large Donors\",          # 1\n  \"ActBlue (D)\",           # 2\n  \"WinRed (R)\",            # 3\n  \"Biden Victory Fund\",    # 4\n  \"Trump MAGA JFC\",        # 5\n  \"Biden 2020\",            # 6\n  \"Trump 2020\"             # 7\n))\n\n# EXACT SAME LENGTH for source, target, value (8 rows)\nlinks20 &lt;- data.frame(\n  source = c(0,1, 0,1, 2,3, 4,5),\n  target = c(2,2, 3,3, 4,5, 6,7),\n  value  = c(600,450, 500,400, 1050,770, 1050,774)\n)\n\ns20 &lt;- sankeyNetwork(\n  Links = links20, Nodes = nodes20,\n  Source = \"source\", Target = \"target\",\n  Value = \"value\", NodeID = \"name\",\n  fontSize = 13, nodeWidth = 30\n)\n\ns20\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\n########## 2024 ##########\n\nnodes24 &lt;- data.frame(name = c(\n  \"Small Donors\",              # 0\n  \"Large Donors\",              # 1\n  \"ActBlue (D)\",               # 2\n  \"WinRed (R)\",                # 3\n  \"Harris/Biden 2024\",         # 4\n  \"Trump Save America JFC\",    # 5\n  \"Save America PAC\",          # 6\n  \"MAGA Inc\",                  # 7\n  \"Trump 2024\"                 # 8\n))\n\n# EXACT SAME LENGTH for source, target, value (10 rows)\nlinks24 &lt;- data.frame(\n  source = c(0,1, 0,1, 2,3, 5,5, 6,7),\n  target = c(2,2, 3,3, 4,5, 6,8, 7,8),\n  value  = c(300,250, 250,200, 315,120, 120,60, 60,90)\n)\n\ns24 &lt;- sankeyNetwork(\n  Links = links24, Nodes = nodes24,\n  Source = \"source\", Target = \"target\",\n  Value = \"value\", NodeID = \"name\",\n  fontSize = 13, nodeWidth = 30\n)\n\ns24\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\n# explain how the plot works, hovering over a stratum tells where the money came froma nd where it is going\n\n\n\n\n3.4.4 Observation:\nThese Sankey diagrams show how donor money moves through fundraising platforms and committees before reaching campaigns. In 2020, the flow was simple and centralized—Democrats mainly used ActBlue, and Republicans used WinRed and a straightforward Trump committee pipeline. By 2024, the pattern becomes much more complex, especially on the Republican side. Trump’s fundraising now runs through multiple connected committees (Save America PAC, MAGA Inc., JFCs, etc.), which helps him collect larger donations, cover expenses the campaign cannot, and keep tighter control over fundraising. Democrats, meanwhile, still maintain a cleaner, streamlined route through ActBlue. Overall, the charts reveal a shift from simpler 2020 fundraising to a more layered and committee-heavy system in 2024.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(dplyr)\nlibrary(tidyr)\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(ggalluvial)\nlibrary(stringr)\n\n# ------------------------------------------------------------\n# 1.

In 2020, a few major candidates dominate the flows: Biden and Sanders rely heavily on individual donors, Bloomberg is fueled mostly by his own loans, and Trump’s funding is a mix of individuals and transfers. Most of this money ultimately goes into operating expenses, with smaller amounts going to refunds or other categories.\nIn 2024, the flows are smaller and spread across more candidates. Harris receives the largest share from individual donors and transfers, while Trump, Haley, and Ramaswamy show mixed funding that includes loans. Again, most money ends up in operating costs, with some flows toward loan repayments for self-funded campaigns.\nOverall, the plot highlights the shift from big, concentrated funding in 2020 to more distributed but smaller funding streams in 2024, while spending patterns remain broadly similar.",

    "text": "By bringing together multiple FEC datasets and visual analyses, we reveal how dramatically the campaign finance landscape has shifted from 2020 to 2024. The 2020 cycle was defined by a huge, competitive Democratic field that drove record fundraising—self-funders like Bloomberg, grassroots-powered candidates like Sanders and Warren, and Biden’s mixed donor base all created a broad, high-volume money environment. In 2024, the field was far smaller. Democratic fundraising quickly consolidated behind Harris after Biden’s withdrawal, while Trump’s financial picture only became clear once we combined his candidate filings with PACs, JFCs, and committee transfers. What first looked fragmented turned into one of the strongest fundraising networks of the cycle.\nAcross both years, a striking pattern repeats: a tiny group of candidates captures nearly all the money. The top few contenders raise and spend at national scale, while most others operate with minimal resources. Burn-rate, cash-on-hand, and spending analyses show how differently campaigns use their funds—some burning through everything to stay competitive, others building reserves, and outside groups like super PACs increasingly acting as parallel financial engines.\nUltimately, the data reveals that modern presidential campaigns are no longer just about raising money they are about navigating and managing an entire financial ecosystem. Donations move through platforms, PACs, joint committees, and party networks before reaching campaigns, making fundraising both more unequal and more strategically engineered than ever before.",
